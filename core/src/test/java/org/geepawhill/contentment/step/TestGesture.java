/**
 * Handy gesture for testing plays.
 * 
 * TestGesture is a gesture that knows and exposes whether it is Undone,
 * Playing, or has Played. Most gestures have asynchronous transition, that is,
 * they go from {@linkplain org.geepawhill.contentment.step.TestGesture.State.Playing} to
 * {@link TestGesture.State.Played} independently. Since it has no way to decide
 * whether it has independently finished running, TestGesture adds the method
 * <code>Finish</code> to enable a tester to mark that. See {@link PhraseTest}
 * for a good sample usage.
